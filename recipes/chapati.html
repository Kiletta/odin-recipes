        Chapati is a beloved dish in East Africa, especially in Kenya, where it is enjoyed during family meals and special occasions. 
        Made from wheat flour, water, and oil, chapati is known for its soft, layered texture and delicious taste. 
        It is commonly served with stews, curries, or even eaten on its own with tea. The preparation involves kneading the dough, 
        rolling it into thin circles, and cooking it on a hot skillet until perfectly golden. Chapati holds a special place in Kenyan cuisine, 
        symbolizing warmth and togetherness.
