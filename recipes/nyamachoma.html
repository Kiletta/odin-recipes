        Nyama Choma, which translates to "grilled meat" in Swahili, is a beloved Kenyan dish that embodies the spirit of outdoor cooking and communal dining. It is often enjoyed during celebrations, family gatherings, and social events. The dish typically features marinated beef, goat, or chicken that is grilled over an open flame, resulting in a smoky flavor and tender texture. Served with sides like ugali, kachumbari, or roasted potatoes, Nyama Choma is not just a meal; it's a cultural experience that brings people together.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg of beef, goat, or chicken (cut into chunks)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Charcoal for grilling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps for Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the vegetable oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, minced garlic, grated ginger, paprika, salt, and pepper to create a marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the meat to the marinade and mix well. Cover and let it marinate for at least 2 hours (or overnight for best results).</li>
        <li>Prepare the grill by lighting charcoal and allowing it to burn until covered with white ash.</li>
        <li>Place the marinated meat directly on the grill over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Turn the meat occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. Brush with leftover marinade as needed to keep the meat moist.</li>
        <li>Grill the meat until it is cooked through and has a nice char on the outside (cooking time will vary depending on the size and type of meat).</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the meat from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the grilled meat into pieces and serve hot with sides like ugali, kachumbari, or roasted potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
