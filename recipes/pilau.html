    <p>
        Pilau is a cherished dish from the Kenyan coast, celebrated for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. 
        It is a cornerstone of Swahili cuisine, often prepared during special occasions such as weddings, 
        family gatherings, and festivals. Made with fragrant basmati rice, a blend of spices like 
        cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon, and tender meat (usually beef or goat), Pilau embodies the vibrant 
        and diverse culinary traditions of the Kenyan coast.

        <li>500g of beef, goat, or chicken (cubed)</li>
        <li>2 large onions (sliced)</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups of water or broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps for Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the meat: wash it thoroughly, cut it into cubes, and boil it with a pinch of salt until tender. Set it aside along with the broth.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the boiled meat and cook for a few minutes to allow it to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Mix in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and form a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper) and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the basmati rice and stir to coat it evenly with the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or broth, add salt to taste, and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for 20-25 minutes or until fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it gently with a fork and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
